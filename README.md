## Introduction
Hello my name is Daniel I am in 10th grade and I am 15 years old.  I really love soccer and my favorite team is FC BARCELONA and my favorite player is Messi. I currently play competive club soccer and high school soccer. I know alot about the game of soccer so feel free to ask me anytime about soccer. I really want to go to as many World Cup games as I want to next year. I love to meet soccer players some of the most popular players I have met are Rafaeal Leao, Endrick, Rodrygo, Marquinhos, and Gabriel Martenelli.

 The most memorable experience I had this summer was going to the PSG soccer players at their hotel. I woke up at 4:30 so I could leave by 5:30 to get their at 7:00. They were staying in Newport Beach so it was about an hour and a half drive. I got there at 7 and waited for them to leave the hotel to go to training to get a few autographs and pictures. I ended up meeting Marquinhos , Kimpembe, and Luis Enrique the coach. I ended up staying there all the way till 3:00 pm so it was a full day. I am really greatful for my mom for taking me this early in the morning as it meant a lot for me. Some other fun facts about me My favorite food is steak I like it cooked medium well. I also really love  Alfredo pasta with either bowtie shaped pasta or penne the shape affects the taste in my opinion. Another fun fact my favorite movie right now is Scarface it shows the history of the past and the terrible world of drugs.

For me I have some goals this year in 10th grade. First I would like to get straight A's. Second I would like to be the captain for my club and high school soccer team. I really want to win trophies as well this season league with my club team and I want to bring a ring back to Chatsworth nobody has done that since 1991. Some of my best achievments are getting ther gold plaque in midddle school which means a 4.0 gpa 6th through 8th grade not a single B. 

That is a little bit about me.
